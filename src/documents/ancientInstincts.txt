You can't see a thing!

A roaring and chaotic cacophony of voices suddenly enters your mind from
The leaning tree.

'Your time has come, Outlander, to learn of the Ancient Ways! Your spirit
Has now grown to be as unfettered as the wind, and the unseen secrets that
Flow across the land will now make themselves known to you, should you
Choose to look.'

'Remember this quest is one you must embark upon alone! The wind goes as
The wind wills, and does not follow another.'

'Be as the zephyrs that roar through the land, wandering where your spirit
Wills, unshackled and free. Spread the will of the Ancients across the
Land, liberating Thar-Eris from those who would defile it. These are the
Wishes of the Ancients that patron you.'

'You may begin your journey by invoking the Ancients at this, the Totem of
The Winds.'

The strange and chaotic voices fade away as swiftly as they came, and
A strange feeling enters your spirit as you feel forgotten instincts
Awaken in your depths.'

  A massive, battered gate juts out of the mountainside here to the west.
Its solid iron doors are now rusted and dented through time and sieges.  
What once appears to have been a finely engraved seal that sat in the 
center of the gates is now worn, chipped, and rusted.  Along the top 
rim of the huge gates rise dozens of sharp iron spikes, each adorned 
with the rotting skull of a fallen dwarf.  Their once proud beards are
now stained, tattered, torn, and flowing limply in the breeze that courses 
through the mountain.  The soil at the base of the gate is littered with
countless corpses, some human, some dwarvish, and many, many orcs and
goblins.  Broken spears, their rotting shafts jutting out of the muck, 
lie scattered about.  Nearby are shattered swords, their blades once 
proud but now glinting dully in the light.  Arrows, fired from high above 
cover the ground, as if they were the blades of some demonic grass.  All
about this place the mud, muck, and putrid rotting flesh continues.
