    (Translucent) A faceless soul, streaming blood, races after the swirling flag.

    (White Aura) A humming swarm of wasps and hornets surges about, striking the condemned.
    --aggro (fairly weak.  can't see invis.  bites (poison), sting (physical) attack)

    (Translucent) A faceless soul, streaming blood, races after the swirling flag.
    I believe all these wander.
N- The Near Shor of Acheron
    (White Aura) Demonic Charon, with eyes like embers, herds the condemned into his foul craft.
    His eyes ringed with wheels of fire, the aged pilot of the river Acheron curses
    and snorts before you.  Tossing his head about in disgust, his wooly white
    beard swaying this way and that, his contempt for you is matched only by his
    impatience.  The gnarled and calloused fingers on his heavy hands clutch have
    ferried countless spirits across these murky waters to the Inferno beyond; he
    bids you to not waste his time...
    Charon is in perfect health.

    Charon is using:
    <mainhand wielded>  Charon's Oar    
    --give obulus charon to cross
    You give a blessed obulus to Charon.
    Accepting your gift, Charon impatiently swats you onto his raft.
    With blinding speed he ferries you across the Acheron and pushes you off onto the far bank.
    You stand up, turn, and find him gone.

    As sinners confess to him, Minos wraps his tail around himself to determine what level of Hell they should be banished to.
    A horrendous stench bull grunts and gasps foul breath upon the dusty ground.
    --Takes seeds and sends to second level.    
    You give a handful of green thistlewood seeds to a stench bull.
    The stench bull devours your offering and gets a mad look in his eye!
    Having enticed the beast you grapple with it in a carnal embrace.
    Your passions lull your senses and as you draw away from your conquest you are startled as a serpentine tail wraps around  you, hurling you over the cliff's edge to the circle below!

c- Clinging to the Wind-swept Cliffs
C- Promontory of Cerberus (Can quit here according to attune)
    
    The guardian hound Cerberus tosses its three heads about, howling.

    Rising up, Cerberus' triple-throated roar strikes you with such thunder 
    that you must cover your battered ears.  Slobbering into his greasy 
    beards he bares his huge grinning teeth and his red eyes look you over 
    with voratious hunger.  His flabby belly pants with anticipation and his 
    talons, used to flay and rend the shades below him, scratch the ground 
    in preparation for tearing you to pieces.   
    Cerberus is in perfect health.

    Your best guess is that he is a devil.
    An ominous, hooded figure waits patiently nearby.
    Cerberus is much larger than you.
    He grins evilly with you

    A huge brass bowl lies here dented and covered with bloody slobber.
    Eight feet across and four feet deep is this bowl of Cerberus.
    When you look inside, you see it is empty.
    A huge brass bowl contains:
         Nothing.

    *LEADER* gives a packet of a poisonous sedative to Cerberus.
    *LEADER* tosses a packet of a poisonous sedative at Cerberus, who catches it in one of his mouths!
    Cerberus devours a packet of a poisonous sedative hungrily!
    Cerberus's eyes glaze as the sedative takes affect...
    While the beast is distracted, you quickly follow *LEADER* and scramble down it's tail to the cliffsides below


B- Bahopmet
    You look on in horror at the repulsive devil before you.  Long sharp 
    horns sprout from its shaggy goat-like head and a fiery inverted 
    pentagram burns like an unholy coal upon its forehead.  Its full firm 
    breasts ooze a thick and unnatural milk down to its scaly abdomen.  
    Its black-feathered wings flex in and out in anticipation.  From the 
    thick fur between its goat-like legs a spiky erection intended for you 
    strikes a cold terror in your heart.
    Baphomet is in perfect health.
    
    Baphomet is using:
    <worn on head>      (Invis) (Magical) (Glowing) the Fiery Crown of Baphomet
    <worn about waist>  the silk-skirted Belt of Baphomet
    <held in hand>      (Humming) the Unholy Icon of Baphomet

    -Vuln wrath (or silver), Casts blind, acid blast, vamp touch.
    -Summons blue abashi devils to aid (spear, poison, chill touch).

    shadows, ready to slay and devour intruders to its master's realm.  
    Its reptilian eyes, cold and emotionless, peer unblinking through

    You get a pile of priceless treasures.
    Your body is racked with unholy pain!
    From the darkness rise a cluster of shadowy figures. Ashamed of your foolish greed you stumble to escape their grasp.

    poisonous strings from between his pointy teeth, sticking to his graying
